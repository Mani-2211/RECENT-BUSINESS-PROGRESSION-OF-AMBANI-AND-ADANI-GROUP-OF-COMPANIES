1.1 Stock Market:
Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms Investment in the stock market, is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.
Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, Nestle and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, so they may be considered as part of the Swiss stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as American depository receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.
1.1.1 Size of The Markets:
The total market capitalization of all publicly traded securities worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$93.7 trillion at the end of 2020.
As of 2016, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the Australian Securities Exchange, these 16 exchanges are all in North America, Europe, or Asia.
 
By country, the largest stock markets as of January 2022 are in the United States of America (about 59.9%), followed by Japan (about 6.2%) and the United Kingdom (about 3.9%).
1.2 Stock Exchange:
A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded "over the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, to attract international investors.
Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC. Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or
security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.
Participants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange trader.
Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodities exchanges and involves traders shouting bids and offering prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.
A potential buyer bids a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller asks for a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling at the Market means you will accept any ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.
The purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a marketplace. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating price discovery.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a hybrid market for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the trading floor.
2

Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a floor broker, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated market maker ("DMM") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If abid–ask spread exists, no trade immediately takes place in this case, the DMM may use its resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the "tape" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially in program trading.
The NASDAQ is an electronic exchange, where all of the tradingare done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ market makers will always provide a bid and ask the price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.
The Paris Bourse, now part of Euronext, is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Before the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. Stockbrokers met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the CAT’S trading system was introduced, and the order matching system was fully automated.
People trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counterparties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are Instinet, and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the commissions of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as adverse selection. Financial regulators have probed dark pools.
1.3 Market Participants:
Market participants include individual retail investors, institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, investor groups, banks, and various other financial institutions), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their shares. Robo-advisors, which automate investment for individuals are also major participants.

1.4. Indirect Vs. Direct Investment
Indirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund. Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.
Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time.Reediest, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each is taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way, the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.
1.5 Participation by Income and Wealth Strata:
Rates of participation and the value of holdings differ significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock, and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts. The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%. The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007. The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively. Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution has lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same period, households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%. The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013. In the top deciles, the mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 at the same time. The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.
1.6 Participation by Race and Gender:
The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households
4

headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011, the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households, the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households, it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female- headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.
1.7 Determinants and Possible Explanations of Stocks Market Participation:
A 2003 paper by Vising-Jorgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market. Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik, and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual's decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher-than-average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics. This phenomenon is also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.
1.8 History:
In 12th-century France, the courtiers de change were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. The Italian historian Lodovico Guicciardini described how, in late 13th-century Bruges, commodity traders gathered outdoors at a market square containing an inn owned by a family called Van der Beurze, and in 1409 they became the "Bruges Bourse", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring countries and "Beurzen" soon opened in Ghent and Rotterdam. International traders, and
5

especially the Italian bankers, present in Bruges since the early 13thcentury, took back the word in their countries to define the place for stock market exchange: first the Italians (Borsa), but soon also the French (Bourse), the Germans (börse), Russians (birža), Czechs (bursa), Swedes (börs), Danes and Norwegians (bars). In most languages, the word coincides with that for money bag, dating back to the Latin bursa, from which also derives the name of the Van der Beurze family.
In the middle of the 13th century, Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa, and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but by a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century. Around this time, a joint stock company—one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders—emerged and became important for the colonization of what Europeans called the "New World".
There are now stock markets in virtually every developed and developing economy, with the world's largest markets being in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, India, China, Canada, Germany (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), France, South Korea, and the Netherlands.
1.9 Importance:
Even in the days before perestroika, socialism was never a monolith. Within the Communist countries, the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, a quasi- syndicalist system of Yugoslavia to the centralized totalitarianism of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor von Mises, the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as "socialist" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. "A stock market," he answered promptly. "A stock market is crucial to the existence of capitalism and private property. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles for the means of production. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist."

1.10 Function and Purpose:
Even in the days before perestroika, socialism was never a monolith. Within the Communist countries, the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, a quasi- syndicalist system of Yugoslavia to the centralized totalitarianism of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor von Mises, the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as "socialist" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. "A stock market," he answered promptly. "A stock market is crucial to the existence of capitalism and private property. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles for the means of production. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist."
The stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly. This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other immovable assets.
History has shown that the price of stocks and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.
Rising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, central banks tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of financial system functions. Financial stability is the raison d'être of central banks.
Exchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the counterparty could default on the transaction.
7

The smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way, the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.
Recent events such as the Global Financial Crisis have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets (called market microstructure), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of systemic risk.
1.11 Behavior of Stock:
Changes in stock prices are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, inflation, and exchange rates. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock's current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock's return growth.
The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information at the current time.
The 'hard' efficient-market hypothesis does not explain the cause of events such as the crash in 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.
This event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect any 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by randomness, although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are not occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.
A 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot systematically profit from any momentary 'market anomaly'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending) [dubious – discuss], many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes
8

in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and value-at- risk limits, theoretically could cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).
Other research has shown that psychological factors may result in exaggerated (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors cancel out). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just noise, e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context, this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self- confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.
Another phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an objective assessment is group thinking. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of the majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter an empty restaurant; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.
In one paper the authors draw an analogy with gambling. In normal times the market behaves like a game of roulette; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.
Stock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects economic growth positively.
Economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends. Macroeconomic trends include such as changes in GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, immigration, productivity, aging populations, innovations, and international finance. increasing corporate profit, increasing
9

profit margins, a higher concentration of business, lower company income, less vigorous activity, less progress, lower investment rates, lower productivity growth, less employee share of corporate revenues, decreasing Worker to Beneficiary ratio (the year 1960 5:1, the year 2009 3:1, the year 2030 2.2:1), increasing female to male ratio college graduates.
Many different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies tend to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large-cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.
1.12 Irrational Behavior:
Sometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself. However, this market behavior may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter-reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected. Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, euphoria, and mass panic.
Over the shortterm, stocks and other securities can be battered or bought by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.
Behaviorists argue that investors often behave irrationally when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money. However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.
1.13 Crashes:
A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in the share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles.
There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since social security and retirement plans are being increasingly privatized and linked to stocks and bonds, and other elements of the market. There have been several famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street
10

Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.
 1929
One of the most famous stock market crashes started on October 24, 1929, on
Black Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the Great Depression.
By the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names "Black Monday" and "Black Tuesday" are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.
 1987
Another famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash
began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.
The crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – the main news and events did not predict
the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the theory of rational human conduct, the theory of market equilibrium, and the efficient-market hypothesis. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to an enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the Federal Reserve System and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of the worldwide financial crisis. In the United States, the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.
 2007-2009
This marked the beginning of the Great Recession. Starting in 2007 and lasting
through 2009, financial markets experienced one of the sharpest declines in decades. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. The housing market, lending market, and even global trade experienced an unimaginable decline. Sub-prime lending led to the housing bubble bursting and was made famous by movies like The Big Short where those holding large mortgages were unwittingly falling prey to lenders. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government
11

intervention to remedy during the period. From October 2007 to March 2009, the S&P 500 fell 57% and wouldn't recover to its 2007 levels until April 2013.
 2020
The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash
that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. This market crash was due to the sudden outbreak of the global pandemic, COVID-19. The crash ended with a new deal that had a positive impact on the market.
1.14Adani Groups:
Adani Group is an Indian multinational conglomerate, headquartered in Ahmedabad. It was founded by Gautam Adani in 1988 as a commodity trading business, with the flagship company Adani Enterprises. The Group's diverse businesses include port management, electric power generation and transmission, renewable energy, mining, airport operations, natural gas, food processing, and infrastructure.
In April 2021, Adani Group crossed US$100 billion in market capitalization, and in April 2022 it crossed the $200 billion mark, in both cases becoming the third Indian conglomerate to do so, after Tata Group and Reliance Industries. In November 2022, it reached $280 billion (INR 24 trillion) surpassing Tata Group. Adani subsequently lost more than $104 billion of market capitalization after fraud and market manipulation allegations by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research. The Adani Group has also attracted other controversies due to various reports of irregular practices. More than 60 percent of the Adani Group's revenue is derived from coal-related businesses. The company's corporate debt totaled $30 billion in 2022.
1.15 History:
Adani Exports Limited started as a commodity trading company in 1988 and expanded into importing and exporting multiple commodities. With a capital of ₹5 lakhs, the company was established as a partnership firm with the flagship company Adani Enterprises, previously Adani Exports. In 1990, the Adani Group developed its port in Mundra to provide a base for its trading operations. It began construction at Mundra in 1995. In 1998, it became the top net foreign exchange earner for India Inc. The company began coal trading in 1999, followed by a joint venture in edible oil refining in 2000 with the formation of Adani Wilmar.
Adani handled 4 Mt of cargo at Mundra in 2002, becoming the largest private port in India. Later in 2006, the company became the largest coal importer in India with 11 Mt of coal handling. The company expanded its business in 2008, purchasing Bunyu Mine in
12

Indonesia which has 180 Mt of coal reserves. In 2009 the firm began generating 330 MW of thermal power. It also built an edible oil refining capacity in India of 2.2 Mt per annum.
The Adani group became India's largest private coal mining company after Adani Enterprises won the Orissa mine rights in 2010. Operations at the Port of Dahej commenced in 2011 and its capacity subsequently grew to 20 Mt. The company also bought the Galilee Basin mine in Australia with 10.4 gigatons (Gt) of coal reserves. It also commissioned 60 Mt of handling capacity for the coal import terminal in Mundra, making it the world's largest.
In 2011, the Adani group also bought Abbot Point port in Australia with 50 Mt of handling capacity. It commissioned India's largest solar power plant with a capacity of 40 MW. As the firm achieved 3,960 MW capacity, it became the largest private sector thermal power producer in India. In 2012 The company shifted its focus to three business clusters – resources, logistics, and energy.
Adani Power emerged as India's largest private power producer in 2014. Adani Power's total installed capacity then stood at 9,280 MW.

1.26Reliance Demerger and Family Feud
The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL. Since its inception, the company was managed by its founder and chairman Dhirubhai Ambani. After suffering a stroke in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of the company to his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of the company was taken up by both brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having differences with his brother Anil over 'ownership issues. He also said that the differences "are in the private domain". The share prices of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal splitting the RIL group business into two parts. In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalized. Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received the telecom, power, entertainment, and financial services business of the group. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group includes Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources, and Reliance Power.
The division of the Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in the de-merger of 4 businesses from RIL. These businesses immediately became part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies.

18 billion cubic meters of gas from its gas-producing block in the Krishna Godavari basin. Subsequently, the two companies agreed to form an independent expert panel to probe any pilferage.
 Cronyism
Seminar magazine (2003) detailed Reliance founder Dhoruba Ambani's proximity
to politicians, his enmity with Bombay Dyeing's Nusli Wadia, the exposes by the Indian Express and Arun Shourie about illegal imports by the company, and overseas share transactions by shell companies, and the botched attempt to acquire Larsen & Toubro.
As early as 1996, Outlook magazine addressed other controversies related to fake and switched shares; insider trading; and a nexus with the state-owned Unit Trust of India.

Five main allegations concerning Reliance, which have plunged the Indian capital markets into a period of uncertainty unsurpassed since the days of the securities scam were:
 Reliance issued fake shares.
 It switched shares sent for transfer by buyers to make illegal profits.
 It indulged in insider trading in shares.
 It established a nexus with the Unit Trust of India to raise huge
sums of money to the detriment of UTI subscribers.
 It attempted to monopolize the private telecom services market
through front companies.
 2005 Criminal investigation
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a charge sheet in a Mumbai court
against Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and four retired employees of National Insurance Company Limited (NICL), including a former CMD, under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act for criminal conspiracy and other charges. Acting on a reference from CVC in March 2005, the CBI started probing the conspiracy that led to the filing of the charge sheet on 9 December 2011. The 2005 complaint had alleged irregularities in the issuance of insurance policies — for coverage of default payments — by NICL to RIL. The charge sheet also mentioned criminal offenses with dishonest intention and causing wrongful loss totaling ₹147.41 crores to NICL and wrongful gain to the private telecom provider.
Two retired senior officials of National Insurance Company Limited and 11 others were awarded varying jail terms by a Delhi court in Jan 2014.
 RIL plane grounded
A business jet owned by Reliance Industries (RIL) was grounded by The
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on 22 March 2014 during a surprise inspection, for carrying expired safety equipment on board; its pilot was also suspended for flying without a license.
 Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin gas controversy
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was supposed to relinquish 25% of the total area
outside the discoveries in 2004 and 2005, as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). However, the entire block was declared as a discovery area and RIL was allowed to retain it. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) criticized the Oil Ministry for this decision. The CAG also faulted RIL for limiting the competition in contracts, stating that RIL awarded a $1.1 billion contract to Aker on a single-bid basis.
25

 Petition against Reliance Jio
A PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation,
through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of a pan-India license to RJIL by the Government of India. The PIL alleged that RJIL was allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying an additional fee of just INR 16,580 million (US$280 million) which was arbitrary and unreasonable and contributed to a loss of INR 228,420 million (US$3.8 billion) to the exchequer.
The CAG in its draft report alleged rigging of the auction mechanism, whereby an unknown ISP, Infotech Broadband Services Pvt Ltd, acquired the spectrum by bidding 5000 times its net worth, after which the company was sold to Reliance Industries.
 Future Retail deal and possession
In February 2022, Reliance terminated the leases of hundreds of Future Retail
locations, the next largest retail chain in India, and took possession of those brick-and- mortar shops. Future Retail had a deal to sell its assets to Reliance, but that deal was contested by Amazon.com, which in 2019 acquired a stake in a subunit of Future Retail along with certain rights concerning the transfer of the retailer's assets. Reliance's possessions came after rounds of legal wrangling, including a 2020 arbitration in Singapore and an antitrust review by the Competition Commission of India.
 Stock manipulation and penalty
For manipulating shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited (RPL), Reliance Industries
was fined Rs. 950 crores (about 447 crores in retracted gains and 500 crores in interest) in 2007. In April 2006, RPL went public as a Reliance subsidiary for Rs. 60 per share. The market crashed by 30% after it floated at roughly Rs. 100, and RPL was back at 60.

2.1 Statistics:
The word Statistics came into existence in the 18th century for the collection and arrangement of facts. It is now used in many ways. As a plural noun,
Bowley defines “statistics are numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry”.
Yule defines statistics as “quantitative data, affected to a marked extent, by a multiplicity of causes”.
Horace Sacrist defines: “Statistics means the aggregate of facts, affected to a marked extent by a multiplicity of causes, numerically expressed, enumerated or estimated according to reasonable standards of accuracy, collected systematically for a pre- determined purpose and placed about each other”.
2.2 Functions of statistics:
Functions of statistics are mainly classified into four categories.  Collection of data
 Presentation of data
 Analysis of data
 Interpretation of results

2.2.1 Data Collection
Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an established systematic fashion that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses and evaluate outcomes. The data collection component of research is common to all fields of study including physical and social sciences, humanities, business, etc., while methods vary by discipline, the emphasis on ensuring accurate and honest collection remains the same. The goal for all data collection is to capture quality evidence that then translates to rich data analysis and allows the building of a convincing and credible answer to questions that have been posted. Regardless of the field of study or preference for defining data (quantitative, qualitative), accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity of research. both the selection of appropriate data collection instruments (existing, modified, or newly developed) and delineated instructions for their correct use reduce the likelihood of errors occurring.
Data collection is one of the most important stages in conducting research, we can have the best research design in the world but if we cannot collect the required data we will not be able to complete the project. Data collection is a very demanding job that needsthorough planning, hard work, patience, perseverance, and more to be able to complete the task successfully. Data collection starts with determining what kind of data is required followed by the selected sample from a certain population. After that, we need to use a certain instrument to collect the data from the selected sample.
2.2.2 Methods of Collecting Data
Data collection is a process of collecting information from all the relevant sources to find answers to the research problem, test the hypothesis and evaluate the outcomes. Data collection methods can be divided into two categories: the secondary method of data collection and the primary method of data collection.
2.2.2.1 Primary Data
Primary data collection methodsare divided into two groups: quantitative and qualitative Quantitative data collection methods are based on mathematical calculations in various formats. Most of the quantitative data collection and analysis include questionnaires with closed-ended questions, methods of correlation and regression, mean, mode, and median, and others. Qualitative data collection methods, on the contrary, do not involve numbers or mathematical calculations. Qualitative research is closely associated with words, sounds, feelings, emotions, colors, and other elements that are non- quantifiable.
28

2.2.2.2 Secondary Data
Secondary data refers to data that is collected by someone other than the user. Common sources of secondary data for social science include censuses, information collected by government departments, organizational records, and data that was originally collected for other research purposes.
2.2.3 Representation of data:
After the data has been systematically collected and edited the next step is a classification of data. Classification is a process of arranging data into different classes according to their resemblances and affinities. The objectives of the classification of data are
 Simplifying the raw data
 Facilitating comparison
 Duplicating the salient features of the data  Making the data more intelligible
 Eliminating unnecessary details
 Facilitating statistical interpretation
2.3 Classification:
Classification is the process of arranging things or items in groups or classes. Their resemblance and affinities give expression to the units of attributes that may subsist amongst the diversity of individuals.
The classification mainly deals with  Geographical classification  Chronological classification  Qualitative classification
 Quantitative classification
2.4 Tabulation:
It is the process of presenting data collected through surveys, experiments, or records in rows and columns so that it can more easily be understood and can be used for further statistical analysis.
There are five parts to a table
 Title – This is a brief description of the contents and is shown all the top of the table.
29

 Stubs- The extreme left part of the table, where the description of rows is shown, is called stubs.
 Caption and Box-head – The upper part of the table which shows the description of columns and sub-columns is called a caption. The whole of the upper part, including the caption, units of measurement, and column numbers, if any is called Box-head.
 Body – It is a part of the table which shows the figures.
 Source note – This is the part below the Body, where the source of data and
any explanation are shown.
2.5 Diagrams
A diagram is a symbolic representation of information using visualization techniques diagrams have been used since ancient times, but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the techniques use a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface. The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for a diagram.
2.5.1 Types of Diagrams
Data can be represented in many ways. The 4 main types of graphs are bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and diagrams.
 The bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart.
 The line chart is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments.
 A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents.
 A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.

2.6 Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode, while measures of variability include the standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, and kurtosis and skewness. Measures of central tendency describe the center position of a distribution for a dataset. A person analyzes the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median, or mode, which measures the most common patterns of the analyzed data set.
The measure of variability or the measures of spread aids in analyzing how to spread out the distribution for a set of data.
Among the various measures of descriptive statistics, some of the most widely used measures are briefly described as follows:
 Average
 Standard deviation 2.6.1 Average:
An average is a typical value, or representative, of a set of data. Since such typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of data arranged according to magnitude, averages are also called measures of central tendency. Several types of averages can be defined, the most common being
 Arithmetic mean  Median
 Mode
 Geometric mean  Harmonic mean
2.6.1.1 Characteristics of average:
 It should be well defined
 It should be easy to compute
 It should be based on all the observations
 It should not be affected by extreme observations  It should be capable of further algebraic treatment  It should not be affected by sampling fluctuations
31

2.6.2 Standard deviation:
Karl Pearson introduces the concept of standard deviation in 1893. It is the most
important measure of dispersion and is widely used in many statistical formulae. Standard deviation is also called Root-mean-square deviation. The reason is that it is the square- root of the mean of the square deviation from the arithmetic mean. It provides accurate results. The Square of standard deviation is called variance.
It is defined as the positive square root of the arithmetic mean of the square of the deviation of the given observation from their arithmetic mean.
The standard deviation is denoted by the Greek letter (sigma)
2.6.3 Range:
The range is defined to be the difference between the largest and the smallest of the observations.
Range = L – S
L and S are the largest and the smallest of the observations.
2.7 Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting. Familiar methods such as linear regression and ordinary least squares regression are parametric in that the regression function is defined in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite- dimensional. In regression. In regression, predictor variables are measured with error. 2.7.1 Regression Models
Regression models involve the following variables
 The unknown parameters, denoted as B, may represent a scalar or a
vector.
 The independent variable X.  The dependent variable is Y.
Where,
32
 2.6.4 Coefficient of Variation
The coefficient of variation (CV) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
The higher the coefficient of variation, the greater the level of dispersion around the mean. It is generally expressed as a percentage
Coefficient of Variation (CV) = (Standard Deviation/Mean) × 100.

The simple regression model is,
 =  + 
The model for multiple regression is,
 =  + 11 + 
Consider a random observation ,,... ,,=1,2,3... the+1
randomvariable is assumed to satisfy the linear model
 =+ +++=1,2,3......
Where,
 - values of an unobserved error term u, and the unknown parameter are constants.
2.7.2.1 Assumptions
The error term u, are mutually independent and identically distributed, withmean=0 and constant variables.
[]=0[]= !
This is not because the observation  ,  , ... " are a random sample, they are
mutually independent and hence the error is also mutually independent. The distribution of the error term is independent of the joint distribution of  ,,...". The unknown parameters are,  ,  ...  constants.
The equation relating the n observation can be written as
=#+# +⋯+# =#+# +⋯+# + =#+#"+⋯+# +"
2.8 Time Series Analysis
A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order. In investing, a time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points, such as a security's price, over a specified period of time with data points recorded at regular intervals. No minimum or maximum amount of time must be included, allowing the data to be gathered in a way that provides the information being sought by the investor or analyst examining the activity.
Time series data are a collection of ordered observations recorded at a specific time, for instance, hours, months, or years.
2.7.2 Multiple Regression Analysis
33

Most often, the observations are made at regular time intervals. Time series analysis accounts for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure, such as autocorrelation, trend, or seasonal variation.
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. It focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time.
Time series forecasting is the use of a time series model to predict future values based on previously observed values in the series.
34
 In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values.
Y = T + C+ S + I
Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data.
 2.8.1 Assumptions:
 There is only one assumption in TSA, which is “stationary,” which means that the origin of time does not affect the properties of the process under the statistical factor.
 2.8.1.1 Stationary
  In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (or a strict/strictly stationary process or strong/strongly stationary process) is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. If you draw a line through the middle of a stationary process then it should be flat; it may have 'seasonal' cycles, but overall, it does not trend up or down.
Since stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary. The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due either to the presence of a unit root or a deterministic trend. In the former case of a unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting. In the latter case of a deterministic trend, the process is called a trend-stationary process, and stochastic shocks have only transitory effects after which the variable tends toward a deterministically evolving (non-constant) mean.
A trend stationary process is not strictly stationary, but can easily be transformed into a stationary process by removing the underlying trend, which is solely a function of

35
 time. Similarly, processes with one or more-unit roots can be made stationary through differencing. An important type of non-stationary process that does not include a trend- like behavior is a cyclo stationary process, which is a stochastic process that varies cyclically with time.
For many applications, strict-sense stationarity is too restrictive. Other forms of stationarity such as wide-sense stationarity or Nth-order stationarity are then employed. The definitions for different kinds of stationarity are not consistent among different authors.
 2.8.2 Need for Time-Series Analysis
  Time series analysis has a range of applications in statistics, sales, economics, and
many more areas. The common point is the technique used to model the data over a given time.The reasons for doing a time series analysis are as follows:
 Features: Time series analysis can be used to track features like trend, seasonality,

and variability.
 Forecasting: Time series analysis can aid in the prediction of stock prices. It is used
if you would like to know if the price will rise or fall and how much it will rise or
fall.
 Inferences: You can predict the value and draw inferences from data using Time series analysis.
2.8.3Components of Time Series Analysis
The various reasons or the forces which affect the values of an observation in a time series are components of a time series. The four categories of the components of time series are
2.8.3.1 Trend
The trend shows the general tendency of the data to increase or decrease during a long period of time. A trend is a smooth, general, long-term, average tendency. It is not always necessary that the increase or decrease is in the same direction throughout the given period of time.
       chronological order. The statistical data is collected over some time. According to Spiegel, “A time series is a set of observations taken at specified times, usually at equal intervals.” There exist various forces that affect the values of the phenomenon in a time series.
Time series refers to the arrangement and presentation of statistical data in

2.8.3.2 Seasonal Variations
These are the rhythmic forces that operate regularly and periodicallyfor less dan a year. They have the same or almost the same pattern during a period of 12 months. This variation will be present in a time series if the data are recorded hourly, daily, weekly, quarterly, or monthly
2.8.3.3 Cyclic Variations
The variations in a time series that operate themselves over a span of more than one year are cyclic. This oscillatory movement has a period of oscillation of more than a year. One complete period is a cycle.
2.8.3.4 Random or Irregular Movements
There is another factor that causes the variation in the variable under study. They are not regular variations and are purely random or irregular. These fluctuations are unforeseen, uncontrollable, unpredictable, and erratic. These forces are earthquakes, wars, floods, and famines. and any other disasters.
2.9 Models
 Multiplicative model
 Additive model 2.9.1 Multiplicative model
Assumes that the various components interact in a multiplicative manner to produce the given values of the overall time series and can be stated as under,
%=&×(×)×*
2.9.2 Additive model
Consider the total of various components resulting in the given values of the overall time series and can be stated as
%=&+(+)+*
Where Y= Observed values of time series T=Trend
C-Cyclical fluctuations
S-Seasonal fluctuations
I= Irregular fluctuations
There are several methods of isolating trends from the given series viz., The
freehand method, semi-average method, method of moving averages, method of least
36

squares and similarly there are methods of measuring cyclical and seasonal variations, and whatever variances are left over are considered random or irregular fluctuations.
2.10 Time Series Methods
Time series methods use historical data as the basis for estimating future outcomes.  Time Moving Average
 Weighted Moving Average
 Kalman Filtering
 Exponential Smoothing
 Auto Regression Moving Average (ARMA)
Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). e.g., Box-
Jenkins
 Extrapolation
 Linear Prediction
 Trend Estimation
 Growth Curve
2.11 Holt-Winters' Method
Holt (1957) and Winters (1960) extended Holt's method to capture seasonality. The Holt-Winters seasonal method comprises the forecast equation and three smoothing equations one for the level Et, one for the trend lt, and one for the seasonal component it, with corresponding smoothing parameters +, #  ,. We use m to denote the frequency of the seasonality. i.e., the number of seasons in a year. For example, for quarterly data m=4, and monthly data m=12.
Two variations of this method differ like the seasonal component. The additive method is preferred when the seasonal variations are roughly constant through the series, while the multiplicative method is preferred when the seasonal variations are changing proportionally to the level of the series. With the additive method, the seasonal component is expressed in absolute terms in the scale of the observed series. and in the level equation, the series is seasonally adjusted by subtracting the seasonal component. Within each year, the seasonal component will add up to approximately zero. With the multiplicative method, the seasonal component is expressed in relative terms (percentages), and the series is seasonally adjusted by dividing through by the seasonal component. Within each year, the seasonal component will sum up to approximately mm.
37
 
2.11.1 Additive method
The component form for the additive method is:
- + h|- lt + h- + 2- + h − 4(6 + 1)
lt=α(9 −st−m)+(1−α)(lt−1+bt−1)
- = # ∗ (lt − lt − 1) + (1 − # ∗)- − 1 2- = ,(- − lt − 1 − bt − 1) + (1 − γ)st − m
where k is the integer part of(h−1)/4(h−1)/4, which ensures that the estimates of the seasonal indices used for forecasting come from the final year of the sample. The level equation shows a weighted average between the seasonally adjusted observation- − 2- − 4 and the non-seasonal forecast(lt − 1 + bt − 1) for time t. The trend equation is identical to Holt's linear method. The seasonal equation shows a weighted average between the current seasonal index, (- − lt − 1 − - − 1), and the seasonal index of the same. season last year (ie., m time periods ago).The equation for the seasonal component is often expressed as
2- = , ∗ (- − lt) + (1 − , ∗)2- − 4
If we substitute ltlt from the smoothing equation for the level of the component
form above, we get
2- = , ∗ (1 − +)(- − lt − 1 − bt − 1) + [1 − , ∗ (1 − +)] − 4,
which is identical to the smoothing equation for the seasonal component we specify here, with,∗(1−+). The usual parameter restriction is 0≤,∗≤1, which
translates to 0 ≤ , ≤1- +. 2.11.2 Multiplicative method
The component form for the multiplicative method is:
- + h|- (lt + h-)2- + h − 4(6 + 1)
lt = αytst − m + (1 − α)(lt − 1 + bt − 1)
- = # ∗ (lt − lt − 1) + (1 − # ∗)- − 1 2- = ,-(lt − 1 − bt − 1) + (1 − γ)st − m
38
               2.12 Trend Line
In finance, a trend line is a bounding line for the price movement of a security. It is formed when a diagonal line can be drawn between a minimum of three or more price pivot points. A line can be drawn between any two points, but it does not qualify as a trend line until tested. Hence the need for the third point, the test. Trend lines are commonly

39
 used to decide entry and exit timing when trading securities. They can also be referred to as a Dutch line, as the concept was first used in Holland.
A support trend line is formed when a securities price decreases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous support pivot points. Similarly, a resistance trend line is formed when a securities price increases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous resistance pivot points. Stock often begins or ends trending because of a stock catalyst such as a product launch or change in management.
Trend lines are a simple and widely used technical analysis approach to judging entry and exit investment timing. Historically, trend lines have been drawn by hand on paper charts, but it is now more common to use charting software that enables trend lines to be drawn on computer-based charts. There is some charting software that will automatically generate trend lines; however, most traders prefer to draw their trend lines.
When establishing trend lines, it is important to choose a chart based on a price interval period that aligns with your trading strategy. Short-term traders tend to use charts based on interval periods, such as 1 minute (i.e., the price of the security is plotted on the chart every 1 minute), with longer-term traders using price charts based on hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly interval periods.
However, periods can also be viewed in terms of years.Trend lines are typically used with price charts; however, they can also be used with a range oftechnical analysis charts such as MACD and RSI. Trend lines can be used to identify positive and negative trending charts, whereby a positive trending chart forms an upsloping line when the support and the resistance pivots points are aligned, and a negative trending chart forms a down sloping line when the support and resistance pivot points are aligned.
Trend lines are used in many ways by traders. If a stock price is moving between support and resistance trend lines, then a basic investment strategy commonly used by traders, is to buy a stock at support and sell at resistance, then short at resistance and cover the short at support. The logic behind this is that when the price returns to an existing principal trend line it may be an opportunity to open new positions in the direction of the trend, in the belief that the trend line will hold and the trend will continue further. A second way is that when price action breaks through the principal trend line of an existing trend, it is evidence that the trend may or may not be going to fail, and a trader may consider trading in the opposite direction to the existing trend or exiting positions in the direction of the trend.

40
 A trend line is a line drawn on a chart highlighting an underlying pattern of individual values. The line itself can take on many forms depending on the shape of the data: straight, curved, etc. This is common practice when using statistical techniques to understand and forecast data (e.g., regression analysis).
Calculating the trend line for a graph indicates a linear relationship. The equation for a linear relationship is
y = mx + b,
where x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the line,
and b is the y-intercept
2.12.1 The rules of a Trend line
Trend lines are simply diagonal lines that highlight a trend or price range. These lines follow the price movement in an attempt to give traders a general sense of how high or low the price might go in a given timeframe. When the price rises, the trendline rises accordingly. When the price falls, the trendline falls.
2.12.2 Uses of Trendline
Trendlines are used to give traders a good idea of the direction an investment's value might move. Understanding the direction of an underlying trend is one of the most basic ways to increase the probability of making a successful trade because it ensures that the general market forces are working in your favor.
2.13 Curve Fitting
Curve fittingis the process of constructing a curve or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a "smooth" function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors.
Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.
For linear-algebraic analysis of data, "fitting" usually means trying to find the curve that minimizes the vertical (y-axis) displacement of a point from the curve

41
 (e.g., ordinary least squares). However, for graphical and image applications, geometric fitting seeks to provide the best visual fit; which usually means trying to minimize the orthogonal distance to the curve (e.g., total least squares), or to otherwise include both axes of displacement of a point from the curve. Geometric fits are not popular because they usually require non-linear and/or iterative calculations, although they have the advantage of a more aesthetic and geometrically accurate result.
2.14 Forecasting
Forecasting is the process of making predictions based on past and present data. Later these can be compared (resolved) against what happens. For example, a company mightestimateits revenue in the next year, then compare it against the actual results. Prediction is a similar but more general term. Forecasting might refer to specific formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or to less formal judgmental methods or the process of prediction and resolution itself. Usage can vary between areas of application: for example, in hydrology, the terms "forecast" and "forecasting" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term "prediction" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period.
Riskanduncertaintyare central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered a good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attached to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date for the forecast to be as accurate as possible. In some cases, the data used to predict the variable of interest is itself forecast.
2.14.1 Basic Types of Forecasting
Forecasting is a method of making informed predictions by using historical data as the main input for determining the course of future trends. Companies use forecasting for many different purposes, such as anticipating future expenses and determining how to allocate their budget. Four common types of forecasting models
  Time series model.
 Econometric model.
 Judgmental forecasting model.  The Delphi method.
 2.14.2 Features of Forecasting
Some important features or characteristics of forecasting are as follows:
  Forecasting is strictly concerned with future events only.

42
  It analysis the probability of a future event or transaction occurring or happening.
 It involves the analysis of data from the past and the present.
 2.14.3 Techniques of Forecasting

 Exponential Smoothing (SES)
 Autoregressive Integration Moving Average (ARIMA)  Neural Network (NN)
 Croston
 2.15 Autoregressive Model
In statistics, econometrics, and signal processing, an autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time- varying processes in nature, economics, behavior, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its previous values and a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus, the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation (or recurrence relation which should not be confused with differential equation). Together with the moving-average (MA) model, it is a special case and key component of the more general autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA) models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure; it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable.
Contrary to the moving-average (MA) model, the autoregressive model is not always stationary as it may contain a unit root.
%9=B+B%9C +B%9C+⋯+B%9C +D9
2.16 Moving Average Model
In time series analysis, the moving-average model (MA model), also known as the moving-average process, is a common approach for modeling univariate time series. The moving-average model specifies that the output variable is cross-correlated with a non- identical to itself random variable.
Together with the autoregressive (AR) model, the moving-average model is a special case and key component of the more general ARMA and ARIMA models of time

43
 series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure. Contrary to the AR model, the finite MA model is always stationary.
The moving-average model should not be confused with the moving average, a distinct concept despite some similarities.
Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by "shifting forward"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.
%E =%9+%9C +⋯+%9CGF
9F
6
 Where,
%E = the forecast value for the next period
9F
%9= the actual value at period t
k = the number of terms in the moving average
A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short- term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. The threshold between short- term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly. It is also used in economics to examine the gross domestic product, employment, or other macroeconomic time series. Mathematically, a moving average is a type of convolution and so it can be viewed as an example of a low-pass filter used in signal processing. When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of order is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.
2.17 ARMA
In the statistical analysis of time series, autoregressive–moving- average(ARMA)modelsprovide a parsimonious description of a(weakly) stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials, one for the autoregression (AR) and the second for the moving average (MA). The general ARMA model was described in the 1951 thesis ofPeter Whittle,Hypothesis testing in time series analysis, and it was popularized in the 1970 book by George E. P. Box and Gwilym Jenkins.
Given a time series of data, the ARMA model is a tool for understanding and, perhaps, predicting future values in this series. The AR part involves regressing the variable on its own lagged (i.e., past) values. The MA part involves modeling the error

 term as a linear combination of error terms occurring contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The model is usually referred to as the ARMA (p, q) model where p is the order of the AR part and q is the order of the MA part (as defined below).
ARMA models can be estimated by using the Box–Jenkins method.
2.18 ARIMA
In statistics and econometrics, and in particular in time series analysis, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. To better comprehend the data or forecast upcoming series points, both of these models are fitted to time series data. ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity in the sense of mean (but not variance/autocovariance), where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the "integrated" part of the model) can be applied to one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity of the mean function (i.e., the trend). When the seasonality shows in a time series, the seasonal-differencingcould be applied to eliminate the seasonal component. Since the ARMA model, according to the World’s decomposition theorem, is theoretically sufficient to describe a regular (purely nondeterministic) wide-sense stationary time series, we are motivated to make stationary a non-stationary time series, e.g., by using differencing, before we can use the ARMA model. Note that if the time series contains a predictable sub-process (pure sine or complex-valued exponential process), the predictable component is treated as a non-zero-mean but periodic (i.e., seasonal) component in the ARIMA framework so that it is eliminated by the seasonal differencing.
The AR part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior) values. The MA part indicates that the regression error is a linear combination of error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The I (for "integrated") indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values (and this differencing process may have been performed more than once). The purpose of each of these features is to make the model fit the data as well as possible.
Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA (p, d, q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q is the order of the moving-average model. Seasonal ARIMA models are usually denoted ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q) m, where m refers
